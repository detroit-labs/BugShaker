BugShaker allows your users to simply submit bug reports by shaking the device.
When a shake is detected, the current screen state is captured and the user is
prompted to submit a bug report via a mail composer with the screenshot attached.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

**NOTE:** There is a known issue with using a mail compose view controller in a simulator
which causes some simulators simulator to crash. You will need to run the example on a
device to test out the full report mail functionality.

## Installation
